        <h2>This is my personal portfolio.</h2>
        <p>I'm a current international student from Uruguay studying Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology! I have always loved computers,
            math, and logic. This led me to knowing what I wanted to study from very early on. <p>
        <p>Fun facts about me:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I have lived in 5 countries: Uruguay, USA (New York and Atlanta), England, Panama, and costa Rica.</li>
            <li>I love to play the drums!</li>
            <li>My two biggest hobbies are: gaming (RTS, Strategy, and MOBA), and sports (Uruguay and soccer are synonyms).</li>
            <li>Learning to cook (specially asian food and meats)</li>
            <li>Taking pictures of landscapes and sunrises (I spend a lot of time traveling when going back home so its nice to enjoy the beautiful colors).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'm always a very happy person and love to try new things and get out of my comfort zone. I truly believe in not thinking and just going for it.
            I think it helps you get things done and remove all the fear and doubt from a situation. Through my many travels, I learnt to appreciate 
            other cultures and meet people from almost everywhere in the world. Leaving your home country is scary, but it certainly helps you get to know
            the world and learn.</p>

        <h2>Hidden Talent</h2>
        <p>My hidden talent would be: coin rolling in your hand, where you constantly roll a coin in your hand. I learnt it from a book I read a couple of years ago,
            where the main character did this while thinking, and I loved the idea to learn that and actually picked up the habit. Its a create way to concentrate
            and relax! I actually have a quarter in my room at all times for when I might want to have fun with it. It's a cool trick that not many people know and a great 
            party trick!</p>
